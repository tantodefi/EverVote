# Evervote with ðŸ†™

Evernote provides a platform for its users to create polls and vote on them through a blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

## Overview

One of the most important tasks of DAOs is governance. On-chain voting mechanisms help decentralized organizations organize resources and implement initiatives by allowing members of their community to create campaigns and rules to allow different segments of their community to vote on different issues. This contract can be highly composable with our whiteListFactory.sol contract.

This smart contract provides a secure and transparent way to manage voting on the blockchain for DAOs.

### Advantages

- **Enhanced Security:** 

Immutability: Data stored on the blockchain is tamper-proof, meaning once recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This helps prevent vote manipulation and fraud.

Decentralization: The distributed ledger technology eliminates the need for a central authority to control the voting process, making it less vulnerable to hacking or manipulation by a single entity.

- **Increased Transparency and Trust:** 

Transparency: All vote transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify the integrity of the process and the results. This fosters increased trust and confidence in the outcome of the poll.

Auditability: The immutable nature of the blockchain allows for easy auditing of the voting process and identification of any potential irregularities.

- **Improved Accessibility and Efficiency:** 

Remote Voting: Blockchain-based polling can enable secure and convenient remote voting, making it easier for people who cannot physically attend polling stations to participate.

Reduced Costs: By eliminating the need for physical polling stations and paper ballots, blockchain-based polls can potentially reduce the overall costs associated with conducting elections.


### Access Control

- Owner of the contract is not able to do CUD (create, update, and delete)
- Owner of the contract is not able to pause the poll
